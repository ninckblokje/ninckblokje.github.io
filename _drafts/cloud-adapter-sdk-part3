## Introduction

I visited the Oracle FMW Summercamp in Lissabon last year and I really wanted to build a Cloud Adapter using the Oracle Cloud Adapter SDK. During the Summercamp I already started, but after I ran into some errors I quit. Now I am starting again.

I want to build a Cloud Adapter for MongoDB. Perhaps Oracle or another party may also build one, but this is for my personal experience and after doing an e-learning and associate certification for MongoDB (which was really challenging!) I want to try it out for myself.

This is the first part of a small series of blogs regarding my effort and will cover the installation proces. Niall Commiskey already has a great [blog post](http://niallcblogs.blogspot.nl/2015/06/408-first-steps-with-cloud-adapter-sdk.html) about installing the Cloud Adapters, however I ran into several problems so I decided to write a post of my own describing my installation steps. I will use Windows 10 and PowerShell (my favourite Windows shell!) for these blogs.  All sources can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ninckblokje/MongoDBCloudAdapter).

Parts:

- Part 1: Installation
- [Part 2: Functionality]({% post_url 2016-03-29-cloud-adapter-sdk-part2 %})
- Part 3: Building the wizard
- Who knows!

Just a small warning: Always keep track of Oracle license information and the Oracle certification matrix!

## Project setup

## Debugging

## Documentation

So I finally found a link to Oracle documentation regarding the Cloud Adapter SDK: [Developing Custom Oracle Cloud Adapters](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/intcs_gs/CCCDG/toc.htm)

## Useful libraries

During development it can be really useful to take a look at the following JAR files:

- $ORACLE_HOME/osb/lib/uitools/oracle.tools.cloud.adapter.sdk.jar
- $ORACLE_HOME/osb/lib/uitools/oracle.tools.uiobjects.sdk.jar
- $ORACLE_HOME/osb/plugins/jdeveloper/extensions/oracle.tools.cloud.adapter.ide.jar
- $ORACLE_HOME/soa/plugins/jdeveloper/extensions/oracle.cloud.adapter.impl.jar
- $ORACLE_HOME/soa/soa/modules/oracle.cloud.adapter_12.1.3/EloquaCloudAdapter.jar
