I am a software developer working for SynTouch B.V. in The Netherlands. I specialize in Oracle Service Bus, Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle WebLogic; but I am also very interested in micro services, continuous integration, continuous delivery, Java and Docker.

GitHub is my public repository, any private repositories I keep at GitLab.
